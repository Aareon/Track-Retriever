# track-retriever

I built this to make it easier for people to work with the tracks that exist in their Spotify playlists 

### Prerequisites

I assume that you have already made a Spotify project, if not you can do that [here](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/)

```
You'll need your: username, client_id, client_secret and redirect_uri
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
